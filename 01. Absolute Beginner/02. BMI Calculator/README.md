# **BMI Calculator Project**

📋 This repository contains a simple BMI (Body Mass Index) calculator project implemented in Python.

## **Project Overview**

🔢 The BMI calculator allows users to input their height and weight and calculates their BMI based on the provided values. BMI is a commonly used metric to assess an individual's body composition and determine if they fall under the underweight, normal weight, overweight, or obese category.

📝 The project is implemented using Python programming language and provides a user-friendly command-line interface. It takes the user's height and weight as inputs and calculates the BMI using the formula: BMI = weight(kg) / height(m)^2.
